## ⚡ About me

I started my career in dentistry in 2007. While I trained as a dental nurse, I realised my real strength really wasn’t chairside — it was at the front of the business, supporting patients. Early on, I led oral hygiene assessment appointments for children and adults and taught tooth-brushing techniques. I quickly discovered that I was good at connecting with people and building trust, even in just a few minutes.

Later I spent most of my time in TCO appointments explaining complex treatment plans for complete smile make overs and Orthodontic treatments, costs, and options in simple terms, and answered the questions people were often nervous to ask. My aim was always to help people feel calm, informed, and comfortable making a decision — without pressure or sales tactics.

I loved being the person who bridged the gap between the clinical team and the patient, making sure nothing felt rushed, confusing, or overwhelming.

In 2013, I joined SkinViva at a pivotal stage — before they had a bricks-and-mortar clinic. Over the next decade, I supported the business as it grew into one of the UK’s leading aesthetic providers and training academies.
During this time, I wore multiple hats contributing and offering support across all areas of the business — front desk, training support, enquiries, sales, and a little marketing. This gave me a deep understanding of how enquiries really work behind the scenes, and how easily good leads can be lost when a team is busy!

One area I’ve always been particularly interested in is why people enquire in the first place — what’s going on in their mind, what they’re worried about, and what helps them feel ready to book. When that journey feels clear and human, it works better for everyone.

After SkinViva was acquired by Harley Academy, I decided to step out on my own so I could support a small number of providers in a more meaningful way. 


### How I Work
I work as a hybrid virtual receptionist, meaning I become a genuine extension of your business — not just someone answering messages.

My role is to:

●Protect your time

●Make sure enquiries are handled with care

●Help turn interest into bookings

We’ll work best together if you believe in keeping things genuine and human. 
I am not super slick and salesy or about gimmicks, scripts, or flashy sales tactics  

In a world which is now led by filtered perfect pictures and polished Instagram captions - I believe in authenticity.  
 

Real conversation, honest answers, and treating people the way you’d want to be treated when making an important life decision
I believe people still want to speak to a real human who is not reading a sales script and not an AI Bot.

### Who I’m a Good Fit For

We’ll work well together if:


✔You’re getting enquiries but struggling to keep up with them

✔You find it hard to follow up consistently

✔You care deeply about client experience

✔You don’t want hard sales or pressure tactics

✔You want someone who understands your industry and your clients

✔If you’re already seeing some success but feel things could run more smoothly behind the scenes, I can help.


### How I Can Help You

It’s a great question — It’s a simple question, but an important one. Rather than telling you what I can do, I prefer to ask what would truly help you the most right now instead?

What would make your day feel lighter?

For some people, it’s not answering emails late at night.
For others, perhaps it’s knowing that enquiries are being handled with care when you don’t have the time or headspace to engage in conversations during an already busy day.
From there, we can connect the dots and build something that actually supports you.

### Here are some of the ways I can help:

●Answer calls, WhatsApps, emails, and DMs in a warm, professional way

●Manage diaries, follow-ups, and reminders to minimise no-shows

●Make sure every enquiry is replied to and followed up properly

●Scheduling and rotas

●Community group management and social media

●Optimise set up of automated processes, patient recalls , reminders etc so they continue silently in the background  

●Guide people from first contact through to booking

●Keep in touch with people who aren’t ready to book yet

●Represent your brand in a way that feels genuine and consistent

●Look at how patients find you and suggest small improvements to make it easier for them to get in touch

●Review your website and the booking process to spot anything that might be stopping enquiries from turning into appointments

●I can also help with lifestyle support such as booking travel, events, conferences, and personal appointments if needed.

#### What I Don’t Offer

I always like to be super clear about what sits outside my realm of expertise. I’m always honest about my competencies, and if you request something that I feel would be better handled by someone else, I’ll let you know and can potentially refer you to a colleague.  I don’t create:

✘Website copy

✘Social media content

✘Health & safety documentation

✘Policies and procedures, or HR documents

✘CQC-related work

✘Long applications (such as award submissions,)

I’m also not a lead generator. My work begins once enquiries arrive. I help manage, engage, and convert the people who already reach out — and often help reconnect with people already in your database.

### A Final Note

The industry loves to sell us quick fixes, but the truth is there isn’t one when it comes to growing a business. Real results come from small, intentional actions implemented consistently — and when combined, they create a powerful impact.

If you’re looking for someone who treats your business as more than just a call-handling service, I’d love to have a relaxed chat and see how I can help.
