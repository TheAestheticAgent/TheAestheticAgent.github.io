							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>I started my career in dentistry in 2007. While I trained as a RDN, I realised my real strength really wasn’t chairside — it was at the front of the business, supporting patients. Early on, I led oral hygiene assessment appointments for children and adults and taught tooth-brushing techniques. I quickly discovered that I was good at connecting with people and building trust, even in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Later I spent most of my time in TCO appointments explaining complex treatment plans for complete smile make overs and Orthodontic treatments, costs, and options in simple terms, and answered the questions people were often nervous to ask. My aim was always to help people feel calm, informed, and comfortable making a decision — without pressure or sales tactics.</p>
I loved being the person who bridged the gap between the clinical team and the patient, making sure nothing felt rushed, confusing, or overwhelming.</p>

							<p>In 2013, I joined SkinViva at a pivotal stage. Founded by husband-and-wife power team Dr Tim Pearce and Miranda Pearce, SkinViva became widely recognised as a leading name in UK aesthetics. I came on board before the business had a bricks-and-mortar clinic and, over the following decade, supported its evolution into one of the world's leading aesthetic providers and training academies.</p>

<p>During this time, I worked across multiple areas of the business, including front desk operations, training support, enquiries, sales, and helped with elements of marketing. </p>
							
							<p>This gave me a deep understanding of how enquiries really work behind the scenes, and how easily good leads can be lost when a team is busy!</p>

						<p></p>One area I’ve always been particularly interested in is why people enquire in the first place — what’s going on in their mind, what they’re worried about, and what helps them feel ready to book. When that journey feels clear and human, it works better for everyone.</p>
<p>After SkinViva was acquired by Harley Academy, I decided to step out on my own so I could support a small number of providers in a more meaningful way. </p>

							<h2>We’ll work best together if..</h2>
							<p>If you believe in keeping things genuine and human. I am not super slick and salesy or about gimmicks, scripts, or flashy sales tactics  
In a world which is now led by filtered perfect pictures and polished Instagram captions - I believe in authenticity.  </p>
 
<p></p>Real conversation, honest answers, and treating people the way you’d want to be treated when making an important life decision</p>
<p>I believe people still want to speak to a real human who is not reading a sales script and not an AI Bot</p>
